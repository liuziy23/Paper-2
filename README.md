Statement on LLM usage: Aspects of the code were written with the help of the chat tool, Chatgpt, and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms_usage.txt. The abstract and introduction were not written with any help of chat tools or auto-complete tools. Grammarly was the only tool I used to check grammar.
